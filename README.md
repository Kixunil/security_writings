# Writings about information security

This repository contains my thoughts on information security in written form. This is a bit of an experiment to see if publishing such things using GitHub is a good idea.
You can watch this repository if you're interested in seeing more articles.
I also have a very similar repository about [programming](https://github.com/Kixunil/programming_writings).

Since I'm starting and I'm not sure what kind of subscription/notification mechanism people prefer and what topics they are interested in, I decided to create [a simple form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv1P1cnWThkXsMqLMOaV0RMG3925F9uDBFKxLArVW2jdm2Jw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for you to tell me which way do you prefer. By filling that form, you'll decrease the chance that you'll miss something from me, so go ahead, it has only up to four questions!

There are currently four articles I wrote (reverse order):

* [Disclosure of security vulnerability in LNURLPoS and LNURLVend](lnurlpos_disclosure.md) - cryptographic bug, title speak for itself.
* [Umbrel is unsecure and you probably don't know it](umbrel_vulnerabilities.md) - important information for Umbrel users about the risks that are not entirely clearly communicated by the authors
* [Somewhat small security risk when initializing LND](security_risk_lnd_init.md) - disclosure of a security issue.
* [Why you should use cookie files instead of passwords](cookie_files.md) - not to be confused with browser cookies! Explains securing your `bitcoind` or a similar (even non-bitcoin) service.
* [Solving information security and procrastination at the same time](solving_security_and_procrastination.md) - explains how it's possible to improve two seemingly unrelated things using the same tool. :)
